                <h2>How to use bitcoin anonymously?</h2>
                <p>
                    As you probably already know, bitcoin is not anonymous (this property was never part of its original design).
                    Bitcoin transactions are chained together in a permanent public record. Analysis of the blockchain may reveal a
                    lot information about your transactions [1] (e.g., recipients of your payments, addresses in your wallet or the
                    balance of your wallet). The following sections contains everything you need to know in order to prevent such
                    kind of blockchain analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    There are currently three main methods how you can make your transactions more private. The first method is
                    called CoinJoin [2] and is based on "joining" your transactions with transactions of other users. Most advanced
                    project based on this method is JoinMarket [3]. This method is very secure, but unfortunately not fully
                    implemented yet. However, the development process continues and the user base is slowly growing. The second
                    method is called Confidential Transactions [4]. In simple terms, this method encrypts amounts in your
                    transactions and helps obfuscate chain of the transactions. This method is not yet part of bitcoin
                    implementation, but may be implemented in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    How bitcoin mixing service works</p>
                <h2>Figure 1: Basic workflow of a Bitcoin Mixing Service</h2>
                <p> The oldest and most often used method is bitcoin mixing (see Figure 1) which works on similar basis as mix
                    network [5]. The bitcoin mixer receives bitcoins to input addresses and sends out different amounts from
                    different input address. This method requires trusting the mixer, but is sufficiently secure when used properly.
                    Manny of our users mix their bitcons for the first time. Because mixing your bitcoins properly requires to
                    follow some simple rules, we decided to write a manual that will make this operation much easier.</p>
                <h2>Buying bitcoins</h2>
                <p> The first step is of course to get some bitcoins. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to buy bitcoins fully
                    anonymously (we will solve that problem later). Most of the bitcoin exchanges have Know Your Customer (KYC)
                    policy. That means you have to provide your ID, driver's license or passport before buying some bitcoins. Even
                    when the identity verification is not required your bitcoins will be still linked to your bank account or your
                    face (when buying in person). Therefore, feel free to chose the service which requires the lowest possible
                    amount of information.</p>
                <p>We recommend using LocalBitcoins.com, since you can buy bitcoins quickly via this service without identity
                    verification in many countries. However, we don't recommend using Tor Browser with this service, because some
                    bitcoin sellers won't sell the bitcoins to you if you are connected via Tor. LocalBitcoins.com is good service,
                    especially if you prefer wire transfer or buying bitcoins in person. It is also possible to buy bitcoins at your
                    local bitcoin ATM or with debit card via circle.com. Unfortunately, not all debit/credit cards are accepted.</p>
